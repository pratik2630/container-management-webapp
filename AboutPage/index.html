                    <p class="page__description"> Docker helps you create a single deployable unit for your application. This unit, also known as a container, has everything the application needs to work. This includes the code (or binary), the runtime, the system tools and libraries.
                        Packing all the requirements into a single unit ensures an identical environment for the application, wherever it is deployed. It also helps to maintain identical development and production setups. Containers also eliminate a whole
                        class of issues caused by files being out of sync or due to subtle differences in the production environments.</p>

                    <h3>Package Software into Standardized Units for Development, Shipment and Deployment</h3>
                    <p class="page__description"> A container is a standard unit of software that packages up code and all its dependencies so the application runs quickly and reliably from one computing environment to another. A Docker container image is a lightweight, standalone,
                        executable package of software that includes everything needed to run an application: code, runtime, system tools, system libraries and settings.</p>
                    <p>Docker containers that run on Docker Engine:</p>
                    <li>Standard: Docker created the industry standard for containers, so they could be portable anywhere</li>
                    <li>Lightweight: Containers share the machineâ€™s OS system kernel and therefore do not require an OS per application, driving higher server efficiencies and reducing server and licensing costs</li>
                    <li>Secure: Applications are safer in containers and Docker provides the strongest default isolation capabilities in the industry</li>

                    <p class="page__description">In Docker, everything is based on Images. An image is a combination of a file system and parameters. A Docker image is a file used to execute code in a Docker container. Docker images act as a set of instructions to build a Docker
                        container, like a template. Docker images also act as the starting point when using Docker. An image is comparable to a snapshot in virtual machine (VM) environments.</p>
